# Ticket Entry Approved/Denied Analysis
> Key words: Machine Learning, Logistic Regression, PCA, Decision Tree, K-Means, Lasso, KNN

### Background
A specific event company overbooked for a concert/event.  
Now they are allowing entry to only some people.  
The goal of the analysis is to find out:  
**What attributes determine the Approved/Denied result of the ticket bookers?**
